            <h3>Background Info</h3>
            <p>One Heck of a Resort is a resort that operates year round in the Swiss Alps. They have plenty of amenities for every time of year with beautiful scenery. It is the perfect escape to get away from your busy life and is loved by the local village.</p>

        <section class="problem">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>One Heck of a Resort required a website that showcases small bits of their resort and provides a contact form. The contact form will allow people to ask questions so people can book a vacation. They currently have no website for any of this and will use the email contact form for booking.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="process">
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The client provided the content, wireframe, and pictures, my role was to create the HTML and CSS for the website. The client only requested a desktop version. I started with using the wireframe to set up the HTML for the website. Then I created the CSS file to style the website. After finishing the CSS, I checked functionality and presented the website to the client. No tweaks were necessary.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="result">
            <h3>Result</h3>
            <p>A work-in-progress website that the client will be reaching out to have finished at a later date. There have been no other known results as the website is still a work-in-progress to get the last section done</p>
